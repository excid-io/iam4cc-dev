description: A Helm chart for the Policy Decision Point for the IAM4CC project

# Autogenerated Notes when running helm's create command.
# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# Auto generated notes about chart versioning.
# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# Auto generated notes about app versioning.
# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "1.0.0"

# NOTE: Changes in version numbers reflect updates and allow us to leverage Helm's versioning, rollbacks, updates and most importantly Helm's 3-way Strategic Merge Path which enables live state tracking to always be able to rollback no matter how the changes where made! 
# DO NOT change the type value.
